# Lookout for Vision (L4V) on Edge Lab

Below is the client used for grabbing a frame from the camera to check your alien for defects.  You can run it manually after you have deployed the L4V Inference Greengrass comontent, which will install the server and the model from S3. After, run the python3 ./inference_client/sample-client-camera.py and it will take a picture, send to L4V Edge, and tell you if it has an anomaly or not.
